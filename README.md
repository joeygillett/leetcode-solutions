# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solution repository!
This repo serves as a log to track the progress of my problem solving journey. I aim to practice and post my results every week to improve my algorithmic thinking and coding fluency.

---

## Progress 

- Weeks completed: `4` Weeks
- Total Problems Solved: `11`

## Repository Structure

- `daily-problems/` - One file per problem, named by date and title
- Each file contains:
    - A brief explanation of the problem
    - Performance comparison of solution in runtime and memory usage
    - The implemented solution code

## Goals

- Stay consistent with weekly practice
- Write clean, readable, well-commented code
- Optimize solutions for time and space complexity
