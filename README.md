# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solution repository! 
This repo serves as a log to track the progress of my problem solving journey. I aim to practice and post my results every day to improve my algorithmic thinking and coding fluency.

## Daily Progress 

- Current Streak: `1` day
- Total Problems Solved: `1`

## Repository Structure

- `daily-problems/` - One file per problem, named by date and title
- Each file contains:
    - A brief explanation of the problem
    - Performance comparison of solution in runtime and memory usage
    - The implemented solution code

## Goals

- Stay consistent with daily practice
- Write clean, readable, well-commented code
- Optimize solutions for time and space complexity
